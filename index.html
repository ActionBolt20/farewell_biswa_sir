        <h1>Farewell, Biswa Sir!</h1>
        <p>Dear Biswa Sir,</p>
        <p>It is truly hard to say goodbye to a teacher who has been more than just an educator—you have been an inspiration, a mentor, and a guiding light in my journey. You were the one who introduced me to the world of coding, and for that, I will always be grateful. Your patience, wisdom, and passion for teaching have left a lasting impact on me.</p>
        <p>As you move on to new opportunities, I want you to know that your teachings will always stay with me. Your lessons went beyond textbooks—they shaped my curiosity and love for technology. I hope you continue to inspire many more students in your new school just as you did with me.</p>
        <p>Wishing you all the success and happiness in this new chapter of your life!</p>
        <p><strong>With gratitude,</strong><br>Ayush Das</p>
